# Snake Game Project

This is a simple Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Overview

The Snake game is a classic arcade game in which the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow in size. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls of the game area or with the snake's own body.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: To create the structure and layout of the game.
- CSS: To style the game and provide visual elements.
- JavaScript: To implement the game logic and handle user interactions.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
3. Eat the food (represented by a dot) to grow the snake and score points.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the game's structure and layout.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides styles for the game elements.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic.
